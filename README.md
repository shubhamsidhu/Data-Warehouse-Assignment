Data storage system and visualization on AIRBNB dataset
Airbnb provides online platform for hosts to accommodate guests with short term lodging. The company does not own any of the properties that are in listings, it acts as a broker receiving commission from each booking. Guests can search for lodging using filters such as lodging types, dates, location and prices. Guests can search specific type of homes such as Entire home / apartment, Shared Room, Private Room and Hotel Room. Before booking users have to provide their personal and payment information. Guests can do the online chatting through their websites to get all the information. Hosts provide prices and other details for their rental properties such as number of guests, home type, rules, amenities. Pricing is determined by the host as per recommended by Airbnb. Hosts and guests can leave the reviews about their experience.
